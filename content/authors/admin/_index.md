I'm currently a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyang Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rHMtSOYAAAAJ&hl=en). I received the bachelor degree from Anhui University of Technology in June 2018.

My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning and machine learning.

<span style="color:red">I will graduate from NUAA with a master's degree in April 2021. I'm looking for a PhD position and opportunity. If you are interested in me, please send me an e-mail. </span>
